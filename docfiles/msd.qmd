$$
\sum F = -kx -c\dot{x}+F_{ext} = m\ddot{x}
$$

Where:

- \( k \) is the spring constant
- \( c \) is the damping coefficient
- \( $F_{ext}$ \) is the external force applied to the system
- \( m \) is the mass of the object
- \( x \) is the displacement from the equilibrium position

$$
x = \frac{-c\dot{x} -m\ddot{x} + F_{ext}}{k}
$$
So displacement as a function of extenal force is given by:
$$
f(x) = \frac{-c\dot{f(x)} -m\ddot{f(x)} + F_{ext}}{k}
$$
Where \( f(x) \) is the displacement as a function of the external force \( F_{ext} \).
so the implemented equation is given by:
$$
x[k+1] = \frac{-c(x[k-1]-x[k]) -m((x[k-1]-x[k])-(x[k-2]-x[k-1])) + F_{ext}}{s}
$$
where \( x[k] \) is the current displacement, \( x[k-1] \) is the previous displacement, and \( x[k-2] \) is the displacement before that \(s\) is the spring constant.
